# Fantasy Football Automation

* in this project I will atempt to write code to automate the fantasy football, since it is a social activity that is a nightmare to those uninterested in football. I will likely fail.

* We will be using the Sleeper API (https://docs.sleeper.com/) as the primary data source, at least thats what I think currently.

Here is an outline established with ChatGPT, which I will try to use only minimally through this project if possible.

# üèà Automating Fantasy Football with Python ‚Äì Step-by-Step Outline

## 1. **Set Up Your Environment**

* Install Python (3.9+ recommended).
* Create a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`).
* Install core libraries:

  * `pandas` (data wrangling)
  * `numpy` (math/stats)
  * `requests` or `httpx` (API calls)
  * `beautifulsoup4` / `lxml` (scraping if no API)
  * `matplotlib` / `seaborn` / `plotly` (visualizations)
  * `schedule` or `APScheduler` (automating tasks)
  * `smtplib` (email notifications)

---

## 2. **Data Collection**

* Choose a source for player & matchup data:

  * Fantasy platform APIs (ESPN, Yahoo, Sleeper, NFL) if available.
  * Public APIs like [Sleeper API](https://docs.sleeper.com/), [MySportsFeeds](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/), or [FantasyPros](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/api/).
  * Scraping if APIs aren‚Äôt accessible.

* Automate weekly pulls:

  * Player stats (yards, touchdowns, injuries).
  * Matchup schedules.
  * Projected vs. actual points.

---

## 3. **Data Storage**

* Store data in a structured way:

  * Local CSV/JSON files (quick + simple).
  * SQLite/PostgreSQL database if you want persistence.
* Create update scripts to refresh datasets weekly/daily.

---

## 4. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

* Standardize player names (APIs may use slightly different formats).
* Handle missing values (injured, bye week).
* Convert stats ‚Üí fantasy points using your league‚Äôs scoring rules.

---

## 5. **Scoring & League Rules**

* Write a function to calculate fantasy points:

  ```python
  def calc_points(stats, scoring_rules):
      points = (
          stats["pass_yards"] * scoring_rules["pass_yards"] +
          stats["pass_td"] * scoring_rules["pass_td"] +
          stats["int"] * scoring_rules["int"] +
          stats["rush_yards"] * scoring_rules["rush_yards"] +
          stats["rush_td"] * scoring_rules["rush_td"]
          # etc...
      )
      return points
  ```
* Store `scoring_rules` in a config file for easy updates.

---

## 6. **Lineup Optimization**

* Create a function that:

  * Takes your roster + free agents.
  * Calculates projected points.
  * Uses optimization (e.g., `PuLP` for linear programming or greedy selection) to set the best lineup.

* Optionally, simulate different lineups (Monte Carlo) to account for variance.

---

## 7. **Waiver Wire & Trade Suggestions**

* Identify underperforming vs. high-upside free agents.
* Compare projected ROS (rest-of-season) points.
* Rank trade offers based on historical + projected output.

---

## 8. **Automation & Scheduling**

* Automate weekly tasks:

  * **Sunday morning:** Run ‚Äúbest lineup‚Äù optimizer.
  * **Tuesday night:** Run waiver analysis.
  * **Daily:** Update injuries/news.

* Use `schedule` library or cron jobs to execute scripts automatically.

---

## 9. **Alerts & Notifications**

* Send updates via:

  * Email (use `smtplib`).
  * Discord/Slack bot.
  * Push notifications (e.g., via Pushover API).

* Examples:

  * ‚Äúüö® Player X is OUT this week.‚Äù
  * ‚Äú‚úÖ Best lineup set: Start Player Y over Player Z.‚Äù


## 10. **Dashboard / Visualization**

* Build a simple dashboard:

  * `matplotlib`/`plotly` ‚Üí Jupyter Notebook reports.
  * Or full web app with **Streamlit** / **Dash**.
* Display:

  * Weekly matchups.
  * Projected lineup score.
  * Waiver wire rankings.

---

‚úÖ End result: You have a Python system that **fetches data, scores players, sets your best lineup, suggests waivers/trades, and alerts you** ‚Äî all automatically.
